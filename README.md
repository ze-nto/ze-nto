Hi, there!

My name is JosÃ© Pereira da Silva Neto. ZÃ© for my friends, Neto for my family.

I'm a Systems Analysis and Development student living in IlhÃ©us, Bahia, Brazil. I have a background in Biology. However, I am more interested in computers and web development for now. So I am looking for a career change, although still working as a Government employee at Universidade Estadual de Santa Cruz as a laboratory technician.

My status:
- :computer: Front-end Developer Jr. 
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently building my portifolio
- :books: Iâ€™m currently learning web development with HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP and Wordpress, Java, Nodejs, ReactJS and Angular.
